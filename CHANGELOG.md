# Changelog

## 0.5.0

- **Add:** Config for `Tokens#createToken` and `Tokens#updateToken` can now include the `referrers` property.

## 0.4.1

- **Fix:** Fix a CORS-related bug that caused Firefox to send preflight `OPTIONS` requests that were rejected by the server. This bug surfaced in Firefox with the Tilequery API, but may possibly have affected some other endpoints and some other browsers.

## 0.4.0

- **Breaking change & fix:** Config for `Static#getStaticImage` now includes a `position` property that can be either `"auto"` or an object with `coordinates`, `zoom`, etc., properties. This fixes buggy behavior with the `"auto"` keyboard by forcing it to be mutually exclusive with all other positioning options.
- **Fix:** Fix bug in `Static#getStaticImage` that resulted in reversed coordinates when creating a polyline overlay.
- **Fix:** Loosen the type validation on coordinates, since longitudes greater than 180 or less than -180 are valid for some APIs.

## 0.3.0

- **Change:** Rename `MapMatching#getMatching` to `MapMatching#getMatch`.
- **Change:** Throw validation error if request configuration object includes invalid properties. This is a breaking change because it could cause your code to throw a new validation error informing you of a mistake in your code. But there is no change to the library's functionality: you'll just need to clean up invalid properties.

## 0.2.0

- **Add:** Add Optimization API service.

## 0.1.3

- **Fix:** Include all services in the UMD bundled client. Several were missing.

## 0.1.2

- **Chore:** Use `@mapbox/fusspot` for validation; remove the local implementation.

## 0.1.1

- **Fix:** `Directions#getDirections` and `Geocoding#forwardGeocode` stringify boolean query parameters like `steps` and `autocomplete`.

## 0.1.0

- Brand new codebase. Please read the documentation and try it out! The `mapbox` npm package is now deprecated in favor of the new `@mapbox/mapbox-sdk`.
