## 1.0.0-beta1

* Add `bbox` option to geocoder API

## 1.0.0-beta

- Changes a major API! Geocoding is now named geocoding everywhere, so the
  sub-require is `mapbox/lib/services/geocoding`, not, like it used to be,
  `mapbox/lib/services/geocoder`
- The `DatasetClient#bulkFeatureUpdate` method is renamed
  `DatasetClient#batchFeatureUpdate` to match the rest of the Mapbox ecosystem.

## 0.12.0

- Add types & country options to geocoder [#65](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-js/pull/65)

## 0.11.0

- Allow pagination options if passed in listFeatures [#61](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-js/pull/61)

## 0.10.0

- Support query params for Directions requests [#58](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-js/pull/58)

## 0.9.0

- Adds a `precision` option to geocodeForward and geocodeReverse methods:
  this allows you to customize how much decimal precision is provided
  wth proximity parameters and the location of geocodeReverse requests,
  potentially increasing cache-friendliness.
