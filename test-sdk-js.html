Test the SDK in the browser
Open the console and use the global method tryServiceMethod. It should log responses and errors to the console. Here's its signature:

tryServiceMethod(
  service: string,
  method: string,
  config: ?Object,
  accessToken: ?string,
  callback: ?(response) => void,
)
You can paste an access token as the last argument or set it as the global variable MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN.

Only use public or very temporary access tokens! This is not a secure place to put a secret token.

An example:

MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'pk....';
tryServiceMethod('styles', 'getStyle', {
  styleId: 'cjgzfhs7k00072rnkgjlcuxsu'
});
